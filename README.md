## Jolby app

## Description

Previously, remote roles were an exception and were limited to very senior engineers around the world. Now, after the COVID pandemic, remote work is the rule in the tech industry even for junior software engineers, so there are a lot of job opportunities published on so many platforms and job boards online. However, looking for offers that adjust to our profile can be exhausting taking so much time filtering the junior offers and the ones accordingly to our experience. The problem mentioned before grows up when we have in count that currently Holberton, Coderise, and other allies are graduating 100+ junior devs every 3 months and every one of them needs to look for this kind of job to begin their professional life. 

Our team, with the support of Coderise, and Holberton Colombia, will attend this situation, by automating all this large and complex exercise, putting together as much as possible remote job opportunities around the whole world exclusively for juniors devs in just one platform, and also allowing the companies itself to publish their own offers directly to it, making the process of looking for a job much easier, faster, and productively.  

It is important to mention that we define the scope of our project to be exclusive to filter junior development jobs in a more efficient way for ourselves and our peers, but we are not making a platform for recruiters, which means that we are not pretending to have contracting or contact processes through the platform, it is intended that each user does it on their own.

This project will help a lot of peers locally, but also could be implemented globally since the fact that we are bringing offers from anywhere, not just Colombia, or the US.
